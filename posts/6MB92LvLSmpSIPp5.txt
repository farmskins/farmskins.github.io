This kind of communication can completely shift the tide of a round, as teams prepare to counter the enemy’s movements based on the sounds they hear."}]
1e:["$","p","29",{"children":"The strategic use of sound also plays into psychological warfare. For instance, faking an engagement by firing shots or making noise near one bombsite can lure defenders away from the real target, allowing for surprise rotations or site takes.

On one side, players commend the improvements in spatial audio, particularly the clarity and separation of different sounds, which they say enhances awareness and tactical decision-making. Footsteps and weapon sounds now offer sharper cues about enemy distance and positioning. However, many players have voiced dissatisfaction, claiming the sounds lack the visceral impact present in CS:GO. Some argue that the new sound system makes it harder to distinguish important audio cues, particularly during intense firefights, leading to confusion and missed opportunities."}]
22:["$","p","37",{"children":"A major point of controversy revolves around the immersion factor. While CS2 aimed for realism, some players feel that the audio is too clean and polished, stripping away the gritty, impactful feel that defined CS:GO. For instance, gunfire, especially from rifles like the AK-47, is often described as less impactful, reducing the tension and excitement of firefights. Reddit discussions are filled with calls for Valve to revisit certain sounds and reintroduce a sense of intensity."}]
23:["$","p","39",{"children":"Another area of discussion is sound balance, with some users reporting difficulty distinguishing certain sound layers in chaotic moments, especially in environments with overlapping noises. This has led to suggestions for fine-tuning or customization options that would allow players to tailor the sound settings more specifically to their needs.
