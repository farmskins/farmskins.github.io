3b:["$","p","89",{"children":"As for the OLED version, it’s for true connoisseurs. It has amazing graphics and more memory, but the price, accordingly, is steep."}]
3c:["$","p","91",{"children":"Ultimately, the choice is yours! The main thing is to decide what’s most important to you: ease of use or the ability to customize the console to the smallest detail."}]

The console will launch with some seriously upgraded versions of blockbuster games like Elden Ring and Cyberpunk 2077, along with fresh exclusives straight from Nintendo’s creative mind. The big deal here is that everything is polished to perfection – each game runs like a dream and is just a couple of clicks away from playing."}]
3f:["$","p","97",{"children":"Now, let’s talk about the Steam Deck – it’s like having a time machine to the vast world of PC gaming in your hands. Craving Baldur’s Gate 3? You got it! Fancy playing Skyrim with a bazillion mods? No problem! Into obscure indie games or retro consoles via emulators? It’s all right there at your fingertips. Think of it as having an entire gaming library in your pocket, where there’s something for everyone."}]
40:["$","p","99",{"children":"Bottom line? If you’re a die-hard Nintendo fan who loves games that just work right out of the box, the Switch 2 is your best bet. But if you’re the type who craves freedom, loves tinkering around, and is willing to do a bit of fiddling with settings to access thousands of games, the Steam Deck will be your new best friend."}]
