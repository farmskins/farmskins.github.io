It is likely that he served a brief detention period during the tournament dates. No official statements have been made by XANTARES or his team regarding the imprisonment, so the community is still awaiting clarification on this unusual situation.

In essence, Eternal Fire sold its lineup to a foreign club so the players could continue competing without fear of prosecution at home. However, the scandal didn’t end there: in June, current Eternal Fire player Ömer \"imoRR\" Karataş was among those detained. He was later released under a travel ban, but his involvement in illegal advertising dealt a serious reputational blow to the organization. Now, the situation with XANTARES adds to the controversy – even though he was officially representing Aurora at the time, many still associate him with Eternal Fire, the team he helped found."}]
