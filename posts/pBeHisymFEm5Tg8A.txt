However, if the game requires you to hold long defensive angles or lock down a site from afar, the MAG-7’s limitations in fire rate and range will work against you."}]
2c:["$","p","67",{"children":"The MAG-7 CS2 is a powerful and cost-effective weapon when used strategically in close-range, chaotic situations. By mastering its strengths—jump-shooting accuracy, positioning, and aiming techniques—you can dominate opponents and even turn eco rounds in your favor. However, understanding its limitations, such as struggles with long-range combat and sustained fire, is crucial. Use the MAG-7 wisely, and it can become a game-changing tool in your Counter-Strike 2 arsenal."}]
