Souvenir drops are a thing of the past, and there is no such thing as an official Dragon Lore case. This makes the skin not only beautiful but also incredibly rare.If you’re a collector or a true CS2 fan, the Dragon Lore could become the crown jewel of your inventory. But be ready to pay a serious amount for it. This isn’t just a skin—it’s a symbol of Counter-Strike, and it’s worth every penny."}]
