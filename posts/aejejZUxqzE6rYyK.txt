19:["$","p","26",{"children":"CS2 pros don’t tilt their keyboards for aesthetic reasons—it’s all about functionality. The primary reason is to create more space for mouse movement. In first-person shooters like CS2, aiming precision is crucial, and many pros play with low mouse sensitivity to improve accuracy. This requires wide, sweeping motions, and tilting the keyboard gives them the extra desk space they need to move their mouse freely without bumping into the keyboard."}]
1a:["$","p","28",{"children":"Ergonomics also play a role. Tilting the keyboard helps prevent players’ elbows from hanging awkwardly off small desks, especially during long gaming sessions. By angling the keyboard, players can sit more comfortably while maintaining precise control over their in-game movements."}]
1b:["$","p","30",{"children":"Another reason is rooted in the old-school days of competitive gaming. In the early 2000s, LAN tournaments were often held in cramped spaces, and tilting the keyboard was a practical solution to fit everything on tiny desks. While the setups have improved over time, many players continue this habit out of tradition or personal comfort."}]
1c:["$","h2","32",{"children":"Keyboard Preferences Among Pro Players"}]
1d:["$","p","34",{"children":"When it comes to keyboards, professional players in CS2 prioritize functionality and performance over flashy designs. One of the most popular choices is the Wooting 60HE, a compact mechanical keyboard that features analog switches, allowing players to fine-tune key actuation points. This level of customization gives pros better control over their movements, which is vital in high-stakes matches. The compact design also frees up desk space for more expansive mouse movements, a crucial factor in a low-sensitivity setup."}]
1e:["$","p","36",{"children":"Another favorite is the HyperX Alloy FPS, known for its durability and minimalist design. Its solid steel frame and Cherry MX switches provide tactile feedback and reliability, making it ideal for intense gaming sessions. Players like EliGE and TenZ opt for compact or tenkeyless models, avoiding the number pad to allow for more desk space—once again ensuring smoother mouse control."}]
