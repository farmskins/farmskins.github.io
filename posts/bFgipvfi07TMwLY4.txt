2d:["$","p","61",{"children":"Every match has a specific rank depending on the matchmaking system. In Premier Mode, players are ranked from 0 and can move beyond 30000. A players rank in this mode is significantly impacted by how well they perform in matches leading the them having an overall higher difficulty in really being able to assess the skill of a player. Each player has a colored rank which can majorly affect their rank. Sometimes, streaks of wins yielding up to 1,000 points can be achieved. Because of this, it is clear that Premier Mode is not as accurate as Faceit as player skills are not consistently represented. In Faceit, players are divided into levels from 1 to 10, and most mid-level players usually receive 20 to 30 points added to their matches after they finish. This takes into account personal statistics and the rating of participants."}]

2f:["$","p","65",{"children":"Faceit has a more modern and effective anti-cheat system than Premier Mode. While cheaters can still be found on CS2 Faceit, their numbers are significantly lower. Upon registration, Faceit requires the installation of a separate anti-cheat client, offering a higher level of protection during matches."}]
30:["$","p","67",{"children":"In contrast, Premier Mode’s anti-cheat is less reliable. The game is plagued by cheaters, even among Prime-status players, revealing that the system is either ineffective or insufficient in identifying and banning offenders. CS also features a tool called Overwatch, allowing users to review and report suspicious behavior, but this feature has limited impact in Premier Mode."}]

33:["$","p","73",{"children":"For beginners, Premier Mode is likely the better option. Instantly accessible upon booting the game, no extra software or sign-up. At those lower ranks, you’re going to be playing against people around your skill level which makes for a great way to learn and really get those fundamentals down."}]

35:["$","p","77",{"children":"Faceit is known as the platform where professionals and experienced players can always get matched up against high skills, and that too with least of the risk to face cheaters. It provides a way for players to transition from being amateur to pro in an environment that is completely safe and regulated. Besides, the site also presents exhaustive statistics in order to assess one’s performance as well as improve their skills."}]
