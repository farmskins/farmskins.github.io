For instance, in the original Half-Life mod known as Counter-Strike, players were met with only a left-hand character model. At that time, there was no knife available in the game, and rounds were inexplicably set to last 8 minutes without any timer display. Although weapons could be purchased during gameplay, the balance of funds wasn’t saved, leading to further confusion. Additionally, the hostage rescue mode did not guarantee a victory upon successful rescue, which left players feeling frustrated and dissatisfied. When the developers introduced the bomb mechanic, it could be planted anywhere on the map, further adding to the chaos. However, these bugs in CS2 went largely unnoticed at the time, as the project was fan-made, created by a group of enthusiastic school kids who were still honing their skills."}]

For example, voice chat was only introduced in version 1.3 in September 2001, and the VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) system made its debut in version 1.4, a year and a half after the original release. Even basic features, such as first-person and third-person spectator modes, were added long after the initial launch, demonstrating a slow but steady evolution of the game."}]

These issues, along with minor grenade hitbox problems, caused discomfort and frustration for players who were simply trying to enjoy the game."}]
