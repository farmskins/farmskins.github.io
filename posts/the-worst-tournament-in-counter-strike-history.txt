The delay for the first match was 25 hours, and the championship had to fit into two days. Because of this, many games, including the third-place match, were played in a Best of One format, and the Dota tournament had to be canceled altogether."}]

Those who knew about MLG TV suffered from constant lag and terrible quality, making it impossible to read player nicknames."}]
